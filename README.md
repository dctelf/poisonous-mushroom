### General comments

I've been a bit 'bytearray()' happy in some of these challenges, when in reality the immutable bytes() type would be more suited.  May consider revisiting some of the code to tighten this up a little.

Also, I'm aware I'm doing a lot of actions that duplicate values (and eat up memory) all over the place and when reading from files I'm loading entire plain/cipher texts into memory rather than work upon blocks at a time.  Hopefully with practise this should improve a little (not entirely sure I want to revisit all the code, but maybe).
